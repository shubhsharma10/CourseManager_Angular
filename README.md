## Workflow:
- To see course/module/lesson/topic/widgets flow with data Follow below path:
- CS5610(Course) -> React(Module) -> State(Lesson) -> Topic 2(Topic)
- You can also go to https://cs5610-summer1-react-ssharma.herokuapp.com/ and
  more data, however that is work in progress as I am including MaterialUI on that,
  so dialog box have extra space around them.
